It's definitely not promoting coal over wood pellets. A lot of the movie discusses the policy in Europe and how incentives in europe have led to a huge number of wood pellet factories cropping up in the Southeast US with very little to no oversight. Furthermore, the accounting for emissions is way off. Enviva is also telling its customers that they are just using the offshoots of responsible forestry to make the wood pellets, but Dogwood Alliance and other groups around here have actually followed the trucks from their production site to the pellet factory and they are clear cutting. If you're suspicious, you might want to just watch the movie", :contributor=>["Nia Spinka"], :created_time=>"2018-02-07T14:32:55+0000"

I don't have time to watch the movie, and therefore I cannot comment on it directly, but I would like to say that I hope people don't see this post and immediately jump to conclusions that everything with the wood pellet industry is bad. There are always things that can be improved upon. I can point to problems with almost any \"green\" energy source. I would also like to point out that the statement \"they are clearcutting massive amounts of NC forest\" is grossly misleading because A.) most of the pellet production does come from forestry byproduct. Those companies harvesting prime wood for pellet production would be the exception and likely won't last long as using high quality timber to produce wood pellets would be a terrible business strategy. 2.) you are implying that clearcutting is bad. It is not. Many of our endangered species in NC require early successional forests or grasslands (i.e. what happens after a forest is clearcut). What would be detrimental is *development* of those clearcut forests.   Edit: I would also like to add, that I understand and support the argument about carbon dioxide emissions, but I would like to point out that the retrieval and transportation of coal takes huge amounts of fossil fuels as well. If we are looking at greenhouse reductions, we can't necessarily claim that the processing of trees into pellets is of equal detriment to the methods of coal extraction without looking at the hard numbers (which would probably take it's own scientific review). I could go on and on about this subject, but the bottom line is that if you plan on being an activist for/against the pellet industry, it's important to not construe the facts or science, which like most science is mixed on this issue.", :contributor=>["Judd Friesen"], :created_time=>"2018-02-08T00:43:14+0000"

It's definitely a complicated issue and in theory it makes sense to burn offshoots of forestry products as a source of energy but in practice in the southeast there's a lot more that comes with it and not all of it good. Could be analogous to how yes we in theory nuclear makes a ton of sense and we should do it but also comes with a lot of issues. If we could do those things responsibly, that could be great.

I saw other companies using giant equipment to do tiny jobs.  I saw wood being rejected during quality control checks at the mill, but it was hauled there and then had to be hauled elsewhere to be landfilled before the county started it's composting program.  These kind of problems are not even in the realm of consideration when people attempt to quantify the overall sustainability of pellet fuel.  I've been laughed at by everyone from prospective clients to city councilpersons and forest service representatives for a myriad of reasons over my career of being \"that guy,\" by which I mean the arborist who is not a tree cutter but as I say, a \"professional tree hugger.\"  In the end, though, many of the ideals I was ridiculed for espousing years ago have become generally accepted today.", :contributor=>["Matilde Champlin"], :created_time=>"2018-02-08T23:20:11+0000"
