The movie, to be frank, just seems like a laundry list of grievances with big businesses.  Of course it's a horrible idea to burn railroad ties next to someone's home, or clear cut without any kind of forestry management plan.  I have a hard time seeing how digging up coal, even if it is more energy-dense, is a better idea than cutting down trees.  If anything, promoting sustainable forestry, for example with Scandinavia as a model, would be a better approach than rejecting pellets.

I would say the lack of accounting for CO2 emissions in the wood pellet industry is highly problematic, and worth paying a lot of attention to. Its a multilateral issue that is being largely ignored. It has pretty devastating impacts on forests in the southeast and generally doesn't help us meet our emission goals, while providing the facade that it does.

Methane leakage from fracking can have devastating impacts on the environment and public health. Carbon emissions and loss of ecosystem services resulting from the wood pellet industry can also have really long term deleterious impacts on climate and on communities.
